# MassSpectra
Investigating the use of foundation models like MassSpecFormer to analyze high-dimensional mass spectra data for extracting patterns and knowledge from raw data that can be applied to various downstream tasks including AMR detection.

To run the code, the dataset (e.g., DRIAMS) can be placed in the same directory as the code, or the source file address should be replaced with the correct dataset address. Due to the size limit, no dataset is included in this Github repository, but for example the DRIAMS dataset can be downloaded from the following URL:
